# DSC180AB-Capstone

Relevant methods used for data exploration can be found in /src/data_exploration.py.
Main script to be ran can be found in /run.py, all that is required to do is to run the file!
Files to be saved during the running of /run.py will be located in /data/out.

### Project Proposal:
Create a classification model to predict a user’s persona based on their device’s specifications,
average CPU utilization, and core temperature.

### Link to download the datasets:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nNpwhzrbKUJd0ZwbCYLGQH49CKkKLTQ4?usp=sharing

The datasets we are using are too large for github. We will be attending office hours sometime week 6 (Feb 8 - 12) to figure out a solution.
The datasets should be stored in /data/raw/.
### Visual Presentation Checkpoint

### Responsibilities:
The dsc180_home.html is the website in which we will present and deploy our predictive model.
flask_homepage.py contains the API to deploy our model.
model.pkl inside the src file contains our model.
We will need to connect the files so that our page prints the outputs of our prediction.
