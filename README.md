# DSC180A-Capstone
Please refer over to notebooks/CHECKPOINT_ONE.ipynb OR ../CHECKPOINT_ONE.pdf for this week's Gradescope submission. I could not figure out how to properly create a run.py that would execute the tests I wanted to conduct. 
The notebook should contain Checkpoint #1 Report and Code!
